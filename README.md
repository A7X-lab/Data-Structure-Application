# Data-Structure-Application
The following Application analyzes a text file and displays frequencies a individual items occur.



1. The program reads and analyzes a text file containing items, focusing on their frequencies.
2. It utilizes several C++ standard library headers, such as `iostream`, `fstream`, `string`, and `map`.
3. The `#pragma once` directive ensures the header file is included only once during compilation.
4. The program defines a function `read_file` that reads the input file and stores item frequencies in a map.
5. Another function, `print_item_freq`, displays the frequency of a specific item.
6. A function `print_list_freq` prints a list of items and their corresponding frequencies.
7. `print_histogram_freq` generates a histogram of items and their frequencies using asterisks.
8. The program can create a data file called "frequency.dat" to back up the frequency information.
9. The `main` function is the entry point, where the program execution starts.
10. The user is presented with a menu-driven interface.
11. The user can choose to search for an item's frequency, print a list of all items and frequencies, generate a histogram, or exit the program.
12. The program utilizes a `do-while` loop to keep the menu active until the user chooses to exit.
13. It demonstrates experience with input/output operations (`cin` and `cout`) for user interaction.
14. The `switch` statement is used for menu selection, showcasing control flow constructs.
15. Functions are defined and implemented outside the `main` function, demonstrating modular and organized coding practices.
16. The program utilizes the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) `map` data structure to store item frequencies.
17. Functions take advantage of parameter passing (by value and by reference) to work with data.
18. Error handling is implemented to handle cases where the data file cannot be created.
19. The program showcases proper file handling practices, including opening and closing file streams.
20. Proper indentation, comments, and meaningful variable names enhance code readability and maintainability.

In summary, this program demonstrates experience in C++ through its usage of standard library headers, data structures, input/output operations, control flow, modular programming, and file handling, all while implementing best coding practices.
